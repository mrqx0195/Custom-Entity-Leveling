# Custom Entity Leveling

A highly customizable mod that enables mobs to gain "levels" similar to elite monsters.

## Introduction

This mod introduces a "leveling" system to Minecraft: Non-player mobs have a chance to spawn with various "levels,"
granting them different enhancements—including attribute boosts and status effects. Defeating these leveled mobs yields
additional loot.

**Note**: The mod does nothing by default. You **MUST** configure it via config files to function. Configuration
guidance is available on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/mrqx0195/Custom-Entity-Leveling/wiki).

Developed for NeoForge's **[2025 Serverside Summer](https://neoforged.net/news/2025serversidesummer/)** event, this mod is server-side compatible. Clients connecting via
vanilla Minecraft *do not* require this mod (or its dependencies, unless other mods need them)—all core features work
seamlessly for vanilla clients.

## License

This mod is open-sourced under the **MIT License**.

You may include it in your modpacks/servers as long as you **comply with the license terms**.
